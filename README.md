My favorite programming language is Python, though I also love HTML and CSS. 


I love to play games and learn new things. I'm currently in the process of learning Cybersecurity in my free time.

Doing this assignment I learned a bunch about Github. I haven't used it before in depth. I learned merging was way easier than I thought it would be. Pull requests are a little fuzzy but I'll get the hang of it sooner or later. Collaborating wasn't too bad we just both had to get the hang of it.
